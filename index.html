      <h2><em>Demeter</em>'s not herself anymore.</h2>
      <p>Once the pride of humanity’s interstellar fleet, the ESS <em>Demeter</em> is on a final voyage to Tau Ceti, where the promise of a new alliance awaits. But something stirs deep within the ship’s rootwork, hidden and ancient, unfolding.</p>
      <p>When psychic interference from a nearby alien moon plunges <em>Demeter</em> into strange silence, an unsettling truth emerges: the ship’s organic systems may no longer be under their control.</p>
      <p>A telepathic technician haunted by her past must reawaken her abilities to help save <em>Demeter</em>. With the aid of a fellow Druid, a disgraced engineer, and a sentient sapling, the crew fights for survival against an unknown intelligence bent on reshaping them.</p>
      <p class="last">With time running out, the remaining crew face an impossible choice: reclaim their home or risk losing the galaxy.</p>
